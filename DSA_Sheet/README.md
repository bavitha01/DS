# DSA Sheet

A comprehensive collection of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems, inspired by **Striver's SDE Sheet**, categorized by topic to aid in systematic learning and practice. This repository is ideal for students, developers, and anyone preparing for coding interviews or brushing up on DSA concepts.
